# Flutter Weather

**Task:**

Please create a simple application that displays:

1) Current temperature in Tallinn.

2) Current conditions - cloudy/sunny/snowing etc

The app should also have an element (button or AppBar button) to call the API and refresh.

You can use open-meteo.com (doesn't require an API key) or any other data source of your choosing.

Points (up to 25):

1) The app has the expected functionality - 15 points

2) The UI looks nice (appropriate alignment of text, font sizes make sense, show that you put some effort into it) - 5 points

3) Bonus - you can type in another location and display forecast for it. - 5 points
